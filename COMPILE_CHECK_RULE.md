# Compile Check Rule

## Rule: Check for Compilation Errors After Code Changes

After completing any code changes or additions, it is mandatory to:

1. **Check for compilation errors** - Verify that the code compiles without errors
2. **Fix any compilation issues** - Address and resolve any syntax or compilation errors found
3. **Continue with logic** - Only proceed with additional logic after ensuring the code compiles successfully

### Implementation Guidelines:

- Always run syntax checks or compilation tests after code modifications
- If errors are found, prioritize fixing them before adding new features
- Use appropriate tools for the programming language (e.g., Python syntax check, TypeScript compilation, etc.)
- Ensure all imports and dependencies are properly resolved
- Verify that the code follows the language's syntax rules

### Benefits:

- Prevents accumulation of errors
- Ensures code quality and maintainability
- Reduces debugging time in later stages
- Maintains a stable development environment

**Note:** This rule applies to all programming languages and frameworks used in the project.
