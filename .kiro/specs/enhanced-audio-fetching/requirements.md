# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing audio fetching functionality in the vocabulary learning application to provide users with comprehensive control over audio pronunciation selection. Currently, the system only fetches audio for flashcards that are missing audio links from Cambridge Dictionary using a single XPath selector. This enhancement will expand the functionality to work on all flashcards, extract multiple pronunciation variants, and provide an intuitive interface for users to preview and select their preferred audio pronunciation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a vocabulary learner, I want to fetch audio for any flashcard (not just those missing audio), so that I can replace incorrect or poor-quality audio with better alternatives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a deck detail page THEN the system SHALL provide audio fetching functionality for all flashcards regardless of existing audio status
2. WHEN I click on an audio fetch button for a flashcard THEN the system SHALL attempt to retrieve audio from Cambridge Dictionary even if the flashcard already has audio
3. WHEN the audio fetching process completes THEN the system SHALL present all available audio options to the user for selection
4. IF no audio is found THEN the system SHALL display a clear message indicating no audio was available

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a vocabulary learner, I want to access multiple pronunciation variants from Cambridge Dictionary, so that I can choose the most appropriate pronunciation for my learning needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system fetches audio from Cambridge Dictionary THEN it SHALL attempt to extract audio from both `//*[@id="audio1"]/source[1]` and `//*[@id="audio2"]/source[1]` XPath selectors
2. WHEN multiple audio sources are found THEN the system SHALL collect all available pronunciation variants
3. WHEN audio variants are available THEN the system SHALL provide clear labels distinguishing between different pronunciation types (e.g., American vs British)
4. IF only one audio source is available THEN the system SHALL still present it in the selection interface for consistency

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a vocabulary learner, I want to preview different audio pronunciations before selecting one, so that I can make an informed choice about which pronunciation to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple audio options are presented THEN the system SHALL provide a preview mechanism for each audio option
2. WHEN I click on a preview button THEN the system SHALL play the corresponding audio pronunciation
3. WHEN I preview an audio option THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating which audio is currently playing
4. WHEN audio playback fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and disable that audio option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a vocabulary learner, I want to select my preferred pronunciation from available options, so that I can save the most suitable audio for my flashcard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio options are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a selection mechanism (radio buttons or similar) for each option
2. WHEN I select an audio option THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating my current selection
3. WHEN I confirm my selection THEN the system SHALL update the flashcard with the chosen audio URL
4. WHEN I choose to keep the existing audio THEN the system SHALL provide an option to cancel without making changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a vocabulary learner, I want the enhanced audio fetching to integrate seamlessly with the existing deck detail interface, so that I can access this functionality without disrupting my current workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a deck detail page THEN the enhanced audio fetching SHALL be accessible through the existing flashcard interface
2. WHEN I trigger audio fetching THEN the system SHALL maintain the current carousel navigation and editing functionality
3. WHEN the audio selection interface is active THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicting interactions with other deck detail features
4. WHEN I complete audio selection THEN the system SHALL return to the normal deck detail view with updated audio information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a vocabulary learner, I want clear feedback during the audio fetching process, so that I understand what the system is doing and can respond appropriately to different outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initiate audio fetching THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator showing the fetch is in progress
2. WHEN audio fetching is successful THEN the system SHALL display the number of audio options found
3. WHEN audio fetching fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the failure
4. WHEN no audio is found THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on alternative actions the user can take

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a vocabulary learner, I want the enhanced audio fetching to work reliably across different devices and network conditions, so that I can use this feature consistently regardless of my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the audio fetching feature on mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and touch-friendly
2. WHEN network connectivity is slow THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate timeout handling and retry mechanisms
3. WHEN the Cambridge Dictionary website is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and inform the user
4. WHEN multiple users access the feature simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain rate limiting to respect the external service
