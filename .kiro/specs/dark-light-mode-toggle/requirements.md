# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a dark mode and light mode toggle functionality for the LearnEnglish vocabulary learning application. Users will be able to switch between dark and light themes to improve their visual experience and reduce eye strain, especially during extended study sessions. The theme preference will be persisted across browser sessions and applied consistently throughout the entire application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between dark mode and light mode, so that I can choose a visual theme that is comfortable for my eyes and study environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the theme toggle button THEN the system SHALL switch between dark and light modes instantly
2. WHEN the theme is changed THEN the system SHALL apply the new theme to all UI elements including backgrounds, text, buttons, cards, and navigation
3. WHEN a user toggles the theme THEN the system SHALL save the preference to localStorage for persistence
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL apply the user's previously saved theme preference
5. IF no theme preference exists THEN the system SHALL default to light mode

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme toggle to be easily accessible from any page, so that I can change the theme whenever I need to without navigating to a settings page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on any page of the application THEN the theme toggle button SHALL be visible and accessible
2. WHEN a user hovers over the theme toggle button THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip indicating the current mode and action
3. WHEN the theme changes THEN the toggle button icon SHALL update to reflect the current theme state
4. WHEN using the application on mobile devices THEN the theme toggle SHALL remain accessible and properly sized

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dark mode to have appropriate contrast and readability, so that I can study effectively without eye strain in low-light environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all text SHALL have sufficient contrast ratio (minimum 4.5:1) against dark backgrounds
2. WHEN dark mode is active THEN flashcard content SHALL remain clearly readable with appropriate color schemes
3. WHEN dark mode is active THEN interactive elements like buttons and links SHALL be clearly distinguishable
4. WHEN dark mode is active THEN form inputs SHALL have clear borders and readable text
5. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the study interface SHALL maintain visual hierarchy and usability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the light mode to maintain the current clean and bright appearance, so that I can continue using the familiar interface when preferred.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN light mode is active THEN the system SHALL maintain the current color scheme and visual design
2. WHEN light mode is active THEN all existing UI elements SHALL display with their original styling
3. WHEN switching from dark to light mode THEN no visual elements SHALL be broken or improperly styled
4. WHEN light mode is active THEN the interface SHALL remain consistent with the current user experience

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme system to be maintainable and extensible, so that future theme-related features can be easily implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the theme system THEN the code SHALL use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent color management
2. WHEN adding new UI components THEN they SHALL automatically inherit the appropriate theme colors
3. WHEN the theme changes THEN the system SHALL use a centralized mechanism to update all components
4. WHEN maintaining the code THEN theme-related styles SHALL be organized in dedicated CSS files
5. WHEN extending the system THEN new themes SHALL be easily addable through the existing architecture
